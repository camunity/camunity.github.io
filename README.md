Feb 9, 2016

The goal of the assignment is to create a personal portfolio using HTML5 and CSS and checking that they are formatted correctly given W3C coding standards. I believe this work has been implemented correctly according to the homework guidelines. 

I did not collaborate with anyone. 

I spent approximately 6-8 hours to complete the assignment.




this is awesome!  great job!  amazing!
